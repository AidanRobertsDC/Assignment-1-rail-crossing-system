Solution 1
Solution 1 is simpler than the other solutions. Itâ€™s simplicity also allows for it to be cheaper to build and maintain.
Its simplicity also reduces environmental impact to construct and run. Reliability is also improved as there is less to go wrong. 
This solution compromises on safety. It does not have the systems to stop the train if there is a blockage or the gates malfunction. 
This increases the risk of the train colliding with vehicles crossing the track.
