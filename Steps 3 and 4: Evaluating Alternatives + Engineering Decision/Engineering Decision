Solution 2 was chosen over the other solutions. Although solution 1 was better in many areas, in a system where accidents can cause death, safety can not be compromised.
Therefore the safety provided by solutions 2 or 3 was required. 
Solution 2 was chosen over solution 3 as it provided the same level of safety while being cheaper to build and maintain, more reliable and having less impact on the environment.
