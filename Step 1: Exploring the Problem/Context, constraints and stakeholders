The stakeholders of the rail crossing are the users and operators of the road and rail.
It is legally and socially required for the crossing to uphold the highest standard of safety.
This requires the technical constraints of being reliable and being able to tell when issues happen.
This is why blockage detection, gate position detection and the ability to stop the train are needed.
It is socially and economically required for the system to have minimal impact on business and travel.
Economics require that the system is cheap to build and maintain. Society adds the constraint that the
environmental impact of the system should be minimal. All these factors must be balanced when designing
the railway crossing.
