Solution 1
The simple one.
This solution prioritizes simplicity and therefore also minimises cost and environmental impact.
The only input would be the train detection. The only output would be the gate control.
To detect the train one rail would be conected to the positve side of a power supply and the other 
rail would be conected to the negitve side of the power supply. When the train was aproching and 
passing through the rail crossing, it's wheels would complete the circuit. By defult the power supplied
into the gate motor causes it to rase, but when the trains wheels complete the train detection circuit
the polarity supplied to the gate motor is reversed causing the gate to close.

Solution 2
The safe one.
This solution prioritizes safety though problem detection. The inputs for this system are train detection, gate state detection, blockage detection and train identification signal.
The outputs of this system are gate motors and stopping the train. To detect the train one rail would be conected to the positve side of a power supply and the other 
rail would be conected to the negitve side of the power supply. When the train was aproching and passing through the rail crossing, it's wheels would complete the circuit.
A switch in the gate mount is actuated when the gate is closed.
# The gate state detection switch was originally on its own mount at the far end of the gate but including it in the gate mount saves cost and lowers enviromental impact.
Blockage detection uses Inductive-loop detector between the tracks to detect any vehicle stuck on the tracks.
# The methord of blockage detection was suggested by AI.
The train identification signal is recived from the train to avoid the train setting of the blockage detection.
# The train identification signal is an evolution of Train-Aware Bypass Logic suggested by AI.
The logic of this system is. If the train is detected lower the gates. After delay, if gate state isn't down stop the train. If train identification signal, then not blockage. If gate state is down and blockage, stop train and raise gates.

Solution 3
Default gate down one
This solution has the gates down by defult. The inputs for this system are train detection, gate state detection, blockage detection, train identification signal and car detection.
The outputs of this system are gate motors and stopping the train. To detect the train one rail would be conected to the positve side of a power supply and the other 
rail would be conected to the negitve side of the power supply. When the train was aproching and passing through the rail crossing, it's wheels would complete the circuit.
A switch in the gate mount is actuated when the gate is closed. Blockage detection uses Inductive-loop detector between the tracks to detect any vehicle stuck on the tracks.
Car detection uses two Inductive-loop detector either side of the tracks to detect any vehicles waiting to cross. The train identification signal is recived from the train to
avoid the train setting of the blockage detection. 
The logic of this system is. If the train is not detected and cars are detected, raise gates and store stop the train. If cars not detected and blockage not detected lower gates and clear storage.
If gate state not closed then store stop the train. If gate state is closed then clear storage. If the train is detected send stored message.
