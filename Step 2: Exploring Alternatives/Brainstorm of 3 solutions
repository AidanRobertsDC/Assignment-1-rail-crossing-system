Solution 1
The simple one.
This solution prioritizes simplicity and therefore also minimises cost and environmental impact.
The only input would be the train detection. The only output would be the gate control.
To detect the train one rail would be conected to the positve side of a power supply and the other 
rail would be conected to the negitve side of the power supply. When the train was aproching and 
passing through the rail crossing, it's wheels would complete the circuit. By defult the power supplied
into the gate motor causes it to rase, but when the trains wheels complete the train detection circuit
the polarity supplied to the gate motor is reversed causing the gate to close.
